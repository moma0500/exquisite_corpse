<p style="font-size:115%;text-align:center;font-style:italic;"><a href="https://www.techdirt.com/pages/support.php" target="_blank">Check out our new list of all the ways you can support Techdirt &raquo;</a>
</p>
<p>
Let's get a few things out of the way first: we are rarely aggressive in asking for support on Techdirt. Many other sites do complete takeovers or popups or have pleas for funding that take up half the screen. We don't do that. However, every so often we do remind folks that we need support to keep running -- so today I'm going to do that with what is hopefully an interesting story <b>and</b> a discussion on the kinds of things we <b>won't</b> do for money.
</p>
<p>
If you haven't yet heard it, I want to recommend a recent episode of the Reply All podcast entitled <a href="https://www.gimletmedia.com/reply-all/123-an-ad-for-the-worst-day-of-your-life#episode-player" target="_blank"><em>An Ad for the Worst Day of Your Life</em></a>. It is quite an amazing story involving a guy whose wife died suddenly and unexpectedly a day after their daughter was born. That happened back in 2008, and the guy, Matt, was quite understandably distraught. He began blogging about his life as a widower and single father. The blog caught on and got more and more attention. Eventually, Matt decided the blog was no longer necessary, pulled it down, and moved on with his life.
</p>
<p>
Then, this year, just as he was about to get remarried, he suddenly started seeing ads with a giant picture of him -- and his dead wife. Those ads were showing up everywhere, thanks to the various sites that include awful units full of "Stories From Around the Web" or "Stuff You May Have Missed" or whatever. You know what they look like. They're always filled with the worst kind of clickbait crap imaginable. "Whatever happened to..." "Eat this if you want to live longer..." That kind of stuff. Here, I just randomly opened up a story on Google News, scrolled to the bottom and got this example:
</p>
<div class="centered">
<a href="https://imgur.com/r0spa4v"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/r0spa4v.png" width=400 /></a>
</div>
<p>
They're all over the damn place -- and many publishers love them, because they pay a lot more than just about any other ads. The Reply All episode calls these "Chumboxes" -- a term I'd not heard before -- and then goes through the process of figuring out how Matt's picture kept showing up in them. It's convoluted, but involves content farms playing a weird arbitrage game of writing clickbait stories and then trying to attract traffic to sell their own ads. A story about a dead wife gets clicks. And that generates more fake stories about Matt and his wife and more ads and more clicks. It's a huge mess of crap, but it pays incredibly well.
</p>
<p>
The two major companies who provide these things are Outbrain and Taboola. And they're big. There are a few other smaller operations, but Outbrain and Taboola are the main ones. Outbrain has raised nearly $200 million and bought up many of its smaller competitors. Taboola has raised $160 million.
</p>
<p>
Here's the thing: Taboola, specifically, has been after us to put these ads on our site for years. We told them no, and they kept coming back. We told them no again and explained that we think those ads are crap and are an insult to our readers (because they are). And the company said, "No, we have quality filters and we promise it'll show good ads." Eventually we said we'd take a look and ran a test with our content using their "quality filters." And, guess what? The ads were still awful crap that would be insulting to you. So we told Taboola no. But they don't let up. Every few weeks we get another request from Taboola. They email. They try to friend us on Linkedin. They try to friend us on Facebook. And we keep saying no.
</p>
<p>
Because, despite what some trolls will say about us doing anything that will get clicks or money, we have no desire for short term revenue that fucks over our community. Because we actually value you guys (even some of our critics). Using crappy services like Taboola and Outbrain shows a lack of trust and lack of respect for your community. It shows a level of short-term money-grab thinking that is insulting and disrespectful. And that's too bad, because the <b>concept</b> behind Taboola and Outbrain <b>could</b> be good. If we could use a service like that which would <b>actually</b> take you to good and relevant information around the web, and get us paid at the same time, that would be great. Indeed, seven or eight years ago we partnered with a company that promised that. And then, a month later, they said they were no longer doing that and wanted us to do sketchy stuff. And we no longer work with that company.
</p>
<p>
We've talked before about how traditional banner ads -- the kinds from Google AdSense, for example -- have become next to useless over the last few years. The rates keep dropping to the point that they're barely worth including at all. In fact, we're exploring some new advertising programs that <b>respect our community</b> by not including <b>any tracking technology at all</b>, so if you happen to work for a company that wants to advertise in a respectful manner, <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/contact.php" target="_blank">please contact us</a>.
</p>
<p>
All of that is to say: we try to respect the community here, even at the expense of revenue. And that sometimes makes things quite difficult. So we need to rely on you, our community, more and more. We try to be as respectful as possible. We don't put up paywalls. We don't complain if you use ad blockers. Hell, we let you <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20150928/17102732388/you-can-now-turn-off-ads-techdirt.shtml">turn off the ads</a> on the site. But we also sometimes need to ask for support, and we've tried to make it possible to support us in many, many, different ways. We've now put up a page that <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/pages/support.php" target="_blank">lists out all the ways you can support us</a>, from <a href="https://rtb.techdirt.com/" target="_blank">becoming an Insider</a> (the easiest and most direct way to support us -- and we're working on some fun updates to that program), to <a href="https://www.patreon.com/techdirt" target="_blank">backing us on Patreon</a>, to <a href="https://teespring.com/stores/techdirt" target="_blank">buying one of our many t-shirt designs</a> (more coming soon) to <a href="https://deals.techdirt.com/" target="_blank">buying products from our deals store</a>, from which receive a commission. We also have a partnership with <a href="https://www.privateinternetaccess.com/pages/techdirt-offer" target="_blank">Private Internet Access</a> if you're looking for a VPN.
</p>
<p>
We're also just now launching <a href="https://jobs.techdirt.com/" target="_blank">a new job board</a> in partnership with ZipRecruiter, and if you're looking to hire someone and post a job there, it helps support us as well (also, if you're looking for a tech job, go check it out).
</p>
<p>
Our goal, as always, is to build and support this community -- but it does take some money to keep things going. We know that not everyone can support us monetarily and we do our absolute best to make the site and community work for everyone, without being annoying or intrusive. But that does mean that every once in a while we may need to remind you that we need your support and explain the way we think about these things.

With so many things competing for everyone’s attention these days, we really appreciate you giving us your time. We work hard every day to put quality content out there for our community.</p>
<p>Techdirt is one of the few remaining truly independent media outlets. We do not have a giant corporation behind us, and we rely heavily on our community to support us, in an age when advertisers are increasingly uninterested in sponsoring small, independent sites &mdash; especially a site like ours that is unwilling to pull punches in its reporting and analysis.</p>
<p>While other websites have resorted to paywalls, registration requirements, and increasingly annoying/intrusive advertising, we have always kept Techdirt open and available to anyone. But in order to continue doing so, <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/pages/support.php" style="font-weight:bold">we need your support</a>. We offer a variety of ways for our readers to support us, from direct donations to special subscriptions and cool merchandise &mdash; and every little bit helps. Thank you.<br></p>

At the same time, you've issues you are protecting the site from and at times send non-regged responses to a oversight bin, I assume to block spammers. <br /> <br /> The end result of that is a valid comment doesn't get posted till long after the news has moved on. <br /> <br /> Say what you will, I'm not giving my info up.

<div class="cbody">The best advertisement experience I've had so far without any interaction was Troy Hunt's blog. He sets up a bar telling who is sponsoring the blog at the time that's loaded from the same address and adds a post when changing sponsorship. Clean and respectful.<br /><br />TD is ok as well and giving the opportunity for visitors to turn off ads without any restriction is pretty bold, awesome and demonstrates a lot of care. I despise advertisements with all I have and that's why I've been supporting TD with the insider thing whenever I can because you guys offer a service I truly like and use daily.

<h3 class="commentsubject">Re: Well that's not desperate at all</h3><div class="cbody"><p> It's probably more that Techdirt's just on a list and occasionally comes up in a rotation for somebody to send a canned e-mail to.</p>
<p>When I was looking for work, there was this one guy who sent me a canned spiel about how he'd tried to call me but the number had been disconnected. Why would you do that? Why would you start off your pitch to a prospective worker by <em> lying</em> to him? And in particular, it's a <em> fucked up</em> lie. Phone service is important to people; why would you mislead someone into thinking they were having phone problems? As it happened, not only was I looking for work, but my grandpa was also in the hospital at the time, on his deathbed; it was <em> especially</em> important that I be reachable by phone at that time, and if I had believed the lie this man had told me and really thought people were trying to call me and getting disconnected, that would have been really stressful to me.</p>
<p>Anyway. I asked him what number he'd tried to call. He tried to change the subject. I asked him <em> again</em> what number he'd tried to call, and he didn't reply.</p>
<p>A few months later, he sent me the same damn e-mail. Same result; I asked him what number he'd tried to call, and he fucked off.</p>
<p>The <em> third</em> time he sent me that e-mail, I responded with something along the lines of, &quot;Hey, guy, this is the third time you've lied to me about my phone being disconnected. Is this company policy, and can you please give me contact information for your supervisor?&quot;</p>
<p>Never heard from him again.</p>
<p>But I think that's pretty much what it takes to get taken off a mailing list like that.</p></div><p class="cmt_ops">[&nbsp;<a class="cmtrp" href="/articles/20180807/11322940388/bad-ads-we-wont-bombard-you-with-other-ways-to-support-techdirt.shtml?cid=315#addyourcomment" cid="315" subject="Re: Well that's not desperate at all" cid="315" title="Reply to this comment..." id="cmmt_link_315" rel="nofollow">reply to this</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href="/articles/20180807/11322940388/bad-ads-we-wont-bombard-you-with-other-ways-to-support-techdirt.shtml#c315">link to this</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href="/articles/20180807/11322940388/bad-ads-we-wont-bombard-you-with-other-ways-to-support-techdirt.shtml?threaded=false#c315">view in chronology</a>&nbsp;]

<div class="cbody"><p> First off, fuck Taboola and their garbage clickbait bullshit ring. Thank you for not associating your site with that trash. It speaks volumes for the quality and integrity of Techdirt.</p>
<p>Having said that, it really doesn't matter what you do, the ads I get are still trash. At the moment, this page is full of adverts for hideously garish fashion websites that I'd rather tear out my own eyes than wear. That's an improvement over the usual adverts for Thai and Russian brides, though.<br />
I'm not sure whether those are better or worse than the current crop of LASIK adverts; I'm guessing they're both targeted at lonely, middle-aged tech geeks, so at least they're homing in on the correct demographic, even if I'm still not interested in getting scammed out of thousands of dollars.</p>
<p>The point I guess I'm trying to make is that, given that the Internet enables me to be at least a moderately well-informed consumer in the way that, historically, it wasn't easy to be without directly contacting manufacturers, most advertising simply bounces off me.<br />
For the most part I already know what's out there and what I'm looking for; I've informed myself and made my decisions before even the most invasive of privacy-invading advertising snooper-bots have registered my interest, and then I spend the next few days watching them desperately trying to sell me something I bought three hours after I started looking (we've all had those weeks where we've bought a washing machine and then spent the next month being served up pages and pages of ads for washing machines).</p>
<p>There really needs to be a big change in advertising to make it relevant to me again. I don't know how they're going to manage to do that.</p></div><p class="cmt_ops">[&nbsp;<a class="cmtrp" href="/articles/20180807/11322940388/bad-ads-we-wont-bombard-you-with-other-ways-to-support-techdirt.shtml?cid=244#addyourcomment" cid="244" subject="" cid="244" title="Reply to this comment..." id="cmmt_link_244" rel="nofollow">reply to this</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href="/articles/20180807/11322940388/bad-ads-we-wont-bombard-you-with-other-ways-to-support-techdirt.shtml#c244">link to this</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href="/articles/20180807/11322940388/bad-ads-we-wont-bombard-you-with-other-ways-to-support-techdirt.shtml?threaded=false#c244">view in chronology</a>&nbsp;]
